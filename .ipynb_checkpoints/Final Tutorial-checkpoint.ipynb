    "### Background and Motivations\n",
    "\n",
    "From the exploration of data in previous projects, we realize how much we can learn from data and make conclusions from analized data. So we want to discuss something what is relavent to everyone, regardless of their interests. Entertainment is relavent to everyone's life, so we decided to explore data about it. At the same time, considering the accuracy of the data from the internet, it is hard to obtain accurate and relatively unbiased data from any websites about entertainment. After browsing many websites and sources, we targeted at Internet Movie Database ([IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/)). IMDb is an online database of information related to films, television programs, home videos and video games. According to wikipedia, IMDb has approximately 5.3 million titles (including episodes) as well as 83 million registered users before Octoer 2018. Because of the authority and completeness of IMDb, we decided to scrap data on the website, analyze the layout of the moive industry globally and try to make some prediction about an incoming movie.\n",
    "\n",
    "### About data\n",
    "The data was scrapped from [IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/). In the raw data, there are 7260 data points, including all of the movies from 1986 to 2018. Each movie has 13 attributes as following:\n",
    "<ul style=\"line-height:25px;\">\n",
    "    <li>Name: name of the movie</li>\n",
    "    <li>Year: year of release</li>\n",
    "    <li>Released: specific date of release</li>\n",
    "    <li>Genre: categories</li>\n",
    "    <li>Rating: content rating(some details)<br>\n",
    "         <ul>\n",
    "             <li>G: General Audiences</li>\n",
    "             <li>PG: Parental Guidance Suggested</li>\n",
    "             <li>PG-13: Special Guidance for Children Under 13</li>\n",
    "             <li>R: Accompanying of parent Under 17</li>\n",
    "             <li>Others: TV-PG, TV-14, TV-MA and NC-17</li>\n",
    "        </ul>\n",
    "    </li>\n",
    "    <li>Runtime: the length of the movie(in minutes)</li>\n",
    "    <li>Score: the score of the movie, from 0 to 10</li>\n",
    "    <li>Votes: the number of comments made regarding the movie</li>\n",
    "    <li>Companies: list of companies involved in the production</li>\n",
    "    <li>Country: the country that produced the movie</li>\n",
    "    <li>Language: the language used in the movie</li>\n",
    "    <li>Budget: budget of a movie</li>\n",
    "    <li>Gross: the profit of a movie, which is revenue minus the cost</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the fact that the data is huge, we scrapped it in the script and stored it in the csv file. But we also put our scrapping code in the notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Relevant information\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea was inspired by a [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/danielgrijalvas/movies) from kaggle about Movie Industry. But their data was out of date (with movies only before 2016) and some of the information was not captured (for some features like company and genre, only one of them was scrapped). Therefore, we decided to write the scrapping code and create our own dataset. We deleted and added a few columns that are relevant to our discussion, made sure that we included all informations we want, and added data from 2017 to 2018.\n"
